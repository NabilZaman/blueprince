This module contains a utility to solve Mora Jai puzzles
using a fairly naive exhaustive search algorithm.

# Usage
Open and modify the `runner.py`.
Run the script and follow the output to solve the puzzle in-game.

If you are having trouble following the instructions,
or suspect a bug in the solver, feel free to enable the `SHOW_DETAIL` flag.

# Spoiler Warning
The runner should be safe to interface with if you are familir with what a Mora Jai puzzle is.

The solver should not be inspected if you are concerned about spoiling
the set of possible rules and configurations a Mora Jai puzzle can be found in.
